This seminar is made possible through a collaboration between [Radius](http://radius.mit.edu/) and the [Philosophy](http://web.mit.edu/philosophy/) section of MIT. This course provides an opportunity to explore a wide range of ethical issues through guided discussions that are geared to equip students for ongoing reflection and action. Lectures and discussions with guest faculty, as well as attendance at on-and off-campus events, expose students to ethical problems and resources for addressing them. The course also encourages students to work collaboratively as they clarify their personal and vocational principles.

Topics vary each term and reflect the interests of those enrolled.
